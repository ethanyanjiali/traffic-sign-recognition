### Preprocess the data here. It is required to normalize the data. Other preprocessing steps could include
### converting to grayscale, etc.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.

### Train your model here.
### Calculate and report the accuracy on the training and validation set.
### Once a final model architecture is selected,
### the accuracy on the test set should be calculated and reported as well.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
